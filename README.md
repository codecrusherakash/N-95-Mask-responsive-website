# N-95-Mask-responsive-website
Responsive website inspired by N-95 masks. Built using HTML,CSS,GSAP and basics JS. Tested on laptop and my mobile(Oppo F17).Not optimized for tablets. Practice project to apply GSAP and responsive design concepts.

Responsive Website (N-95 Inspired),Built to Learn.<br>
This project is my attempt to combine **responsive design** with **GSAP basics** ,made for both laptop and mobile screens.<br>
Tested on my personal device (Oppo F17), it's designed intentionally **not for tablets**, keeping layout crisp and intentional across primary user devices.<br>
Tech Used:<br>
-HTML  <br>
-CSS  <br>
-GSAP (for animation)<br> 
-Basic JavaScript<br>
Why This Project Exists:<br>
After learning GSAP and some responsive design theory, I realized:<br>
> **You don’t truly “know” unless you build.**<br>

So this was built **from scratch**, not following any tutorial just experiments, breaks, fixes, and wins.<br>

I used this project to:<br>
- Understand **mobile-first thinking**<br>  
- Apply **GSAP animations** practically <br>
- Test real responsiveness on physical devices (not just dev tools)<br>
Note:<br>
- This isn’t a big “portfolio piece” it’s a real practice project made with effort and curiosity.<br>
- Optimized only for **laptops and mobiles**, not tablets.<br>

Coming Next:<br>
This project gave me confidence in basic responsiveness.<br>
Next, I’ll build more dynamic UIs — deeper JS, more polished layouts, and sharper design.
